        <p>Nice to meet you!</p>
        <p>
          I am Han Zhang, and you can call me Sam.
          I'm currently studying the Master of Computing in ANU. 
          I'm from China, but currently living in Auckland, New Zealand. 
          I'm really happy to meet everyone and make friends!

        <h1>My passion</h1>
        <p>
          I have many hobbies, but I really love travel and photography. 
          In my part time I usually like to travel around and record what I see with my camera. 
          When I looked up travel destinations on the Internet, 
          most of the results that came up were very famous places, 
          however most places around me were not so famous, so there are only little relevant information, 
          which was very distressing to me.
          So here I hope I can show these wonderful places, and give some reference to the others.
        </p>

          In this website you can find travel blog posts, tourist attractions information, photos, and more.
          You can not only find the information of many famous tourist attractions, 
          but also some small but very characteristic places. 
          At the same time, I will also share some photography-related content, 
          such as camera positions and techniques.

          Sadly, these locations are currently limited to a limited number of places I've been to, 
          most of which are concentrated around Auckland. 
          But I believe that as I travel more and more places, 
          the information on this site will become more and more comprehensive.
