# Artist Statement

<!-- Write your artist statement in this file (max 200 words). -->

My inspiration comes from the lives of myself and people around me. Sometimes we are doing our own things in the house, playing games, watching movies, working or studying, completely unaware of the passage of time. Only when we occasionally look out the window will we know that so long has passed and what is happening in the world outside. Honestly this is an experience I often have. I hope this can arouse people's reflection on the current lifestyle, and I hope we can spend more time outdoors.

I described the scene from looking outside through the window, there are curtains, the window and the scenery outside the window. Close the curtains, time flies, we don't know what it looks like outside. Open the curtains, we can see the city outside, the sky, and the flying birds.

Click the curtain to open or close it. The direction of the bird's flight can be controlled with the mouse. However, because the bird is always flying, it may not come back after a long time. Close the curtains to reset the bird randomly.
