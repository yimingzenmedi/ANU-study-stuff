我选择的课堂内的艺术作品是Piet Mondrian的作品《Broadway Boogie Woogie》。作者用水平竖直的线条和不同大小的方块展现了纽约的城市布局，而不同方块颜色的变化似乎展现了爵士乐的律动。繁华的城市被作者用简单的线条和方块表现出来，并且将听觉融入了视觉，用绘画表现了音乐的感觉，这似乎说明不同的感官之间其实是相通的。这样的艺术形式完全没有使用现实中的形象，但是又充分地体现了现实中的景象。

我选择的另一件艺术作品是赵之谦（1829-1884）的印章“汉学居”。与单纯的艺术作品不同，印章是有实际作用的，在中国文化中一般用于署名或表达情感。然而印章也是极具美感的艺术品，这枚印章则更显特殊。这枚印章并没有采用常用的均匀的布局，而是有疏有密。印章右侧的两个字笔画十分密集，而左侧只有一个字，并且笔画稀疏，留出了大面积的空白。稀疏与密集互相抗衡又互相平衡，对比强烈又不失和谐，平衡与不平衡兼具。这件作品展现了文字的艺术。



The artwork I chose from the lecture is "Broadway Boogie Woogie" by Piet Mondrian. 
He used horizontal and vertical lines and squares of different sizes to show the urban layout of New York, and the changing of the colors of different squares seems to show the rhythm of jazz music. The prosperous city is expressed with simple lines and squares. And, the sense of hearing is integrated into the vision, the feeling of music is expressed with painting, which seems to indicate that different senses are actually connected. This kind of art does not use real objects, but it fully reflects the real scene.

Another artwork I chose is the seal "Han Xue Ju" by Zhiqian Zhao (1829-1884). Unlike pure works of art, seals have practical functions. In Chinese culture, they are generally used to sign names or express emotions. However, the seal is also a kind of artwork, and this seal is even more special. This seal does not use the usual uniform layout, but is dense and sparse. The two characters on the right side of the seal have very dense strokes, while there is only one character on the left, and the strokes are sparse, leaving a large area of ​​blank space. The sparseness and the denseness against with each other and balance each other, the contrast is strong but harmonious, both the balance and the imbalance exist. This work shows the art of character.
