    "**PRIORITIES:**\n",
    "1. Ensure you understand **every step** of (stochastic) gradient desent.\n",
    "2. Ensure you could can derive the gradient of regression problems with or without regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once that's all done, revisit the clustering section. Did you understand everything here as well? Unsupervised learning is important because it not only has immediate practical uses but is more relevant to the development of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) than supervised (labelled) learning. If you don't understand this paragraph, please ask your tutor to clarify the meaning of supervised and unsupservised learning."

    "   **TASK:** \n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. Randomly generate a matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, where each row of $X$ is a training example.\n",
    "   2. Choose a vector $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1}$.\n",
    "   3. Generate $Y$ by $Xt = Y$.\n",
    "   4. Then generate a random matrix $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1}$.\n",
    "   5. Implement gradient descent to approximate $t$ with $\\theta$.\n",
    "   6. Check your gradient descent algorithm correctly approximated $t$. Talk to your classmates and tutor to make sure if you're unsure.\n",
    "   7. Verify your answer with the closed form solution employing the Moore-Penrose inverse.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Note that in the above we're essentially pretending we don't know $t$. Obviously, if we have $t$, linear regression with gradient descent would be unnecessary, but the point is to help you understand what gradient descent is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note: we should use the squared loss function, computed as the square of the difference between the predicted function values and the observed function values (or ground truth). \n",
