00:40:31	Qinyu Zhao:	What’s the difference between self-supervised learning and data augmentation? I feel these images are also results of data augmentation.
00:40:55	Ning Lai:	same question
00:47:12	Qinyu Zhao:	Do we need the Closure property? The “cross” is defined by G cross G -> G. The output of cross must be in G.
00:48:11	Xin Yang:	Same opinion!
00:50:05	Zitian Zhou:	What is the difference between (Z,+) and (Z,-)?
00:50:11	Xin Yang:	So neutral element maybe different based on different operators? Like (Z, +) should be 0 while (Z, x) may be 1.
00:50:51	Qinyu Zhao:	I think so. @Xin
00:51:44	Qinyu Zhao:	Their operations are different. One is addition, and the other is subtraction @zitian
00:52:22	Zitian Zhou:	Yep, got it, thx @Qinyu
00:52:46	Keyang Qian:	why (Z,-) doesn't have a neutral element 0?
00:53:05	Wenhan Dong:	0-2 not equal 2
00:53:10	Jinghang Feng:	such as 5 - 0 = 5  0 - 5 = -5
00:53:21	Keyang Qian:	get it
00:59:46	Xin Yang:	Why 0 element always need to be the element in the subspace?
01:00:59	Maojun Zhu:	If 0 belongs to a subspace then this subspace will never be empty, so what s the meaning for the second property?
01:01:35	Jiajie Li:	not only empty,but also contain 0.
01:01:42	David Quarel:	Formally, the three axioms are
1. closure under addition
2. closure under scalar multiplication
3. is non-empty
01:01:44	Yucheng Zhao:	Is vector subspace also a group?
01:01:53	Jiawei Li:	Just wondering, vector space is a different concept compared with vector?
01:01:54	Jiajie Li:	Some sets may contain elements other than 0.
01:02:05	Feiyang Yu:	So subspaces if R^n can only be R^n?
01:02:10	Junhao, Wang:	what is a homogeneous system
01:02:29	David Quarel:	Now, we can deduce from these axioms that 0 must be in the space. If the space is non-empty, then some vector x is in the space. Then (-1)x = -x is in the space due to axiom 2. Then x - x = 0 is in the space by axiom 1.
01:02:44	David Quarel:	@Jaiwei A vector is defined to be an element of a vector space
01:03:13	David Quarel:	@Feiyang No, we can have non-trivial subspaces of R^n that are not R^n
01:03:33	Xin Yang:	Null space (A) = solution set(A)
01:03:45	Wenhan Dong:	I forget what is "non-trivial" means 
01:04:39	David Quarel:	@Yucheng No, a vector space is not a group as the types don't match. A vector space has two operations, + and x. If you take A vector space V = (S, +, x) and take the set of vectors togetehr with vector addition (S,+), that would form a group
01:05:10	David Quarel:	"non-trivial" means not the vector space{0}, and not the entire space. Both are always subspaces of any vector space, and are as such "trivial"
01:08:58	Feiyang Yu:	Thanks @David Quarel
01:09:59	Yucheng Zhao:	Thanks！
01:11:42	Karthik Vemireddy:	x3 is dependant
01:12:44	Xin Yang:	Do we have a more general method? Gaussian Elimination maybe subtle in some conditions
01:13:35	Surya Teja-u7143732:	maybe you can try k1 = x * k2 + y * k3 and check out if x and y values exist
01:13:49	Surya Teja-u7143732:	where k1 k2 k3 are column vectors
01:14:36	Surya Teja-u7143732:	but the issue is it becomes harder for larger dimensional vectors: ((
01:16:02	David Quarel:	@Surya such an approach ends up being gaussian elimination anyway when you solve for the variables
01:17:30	Ruizheng Shen:	Maybe calculate the determinant？
01:18:07	Denny (Yi Lin):	does anyone know the code of piazza for this course? i have just enrolled and have no idea of that
01:18:11	David Quarel:	COMP3670
01:18:41	Peicheng Liu:	or 6670
01:18:52	David Quarel:	@Ruizheng that can also work, but it won't tell you the values of the coefficients c1,...,cn such that c1 v1 + ... + cn vn = 0
01:18:57	Denny (Yi Lin):	the class access code
01:19:35	David Quarel:	Signup Link: piazza.com/anu.edu.au/fall2021/comp36706670

Access Code: 1234
01:20:08	Denny (Yi Lin):	thanks a lot
01:22:10	Ruizheng Shen:	@David Yes, that’s true. But can we prove linear independence by determinant?
01:22:24	Ruizheng Shen:	I’m not sure about that.
01:22:31	David Quarel:	I suppose so, the columns of a matrix are linearly independant if and only if the matrix is invertible
01:22:51	David Quarel:	and the matrix is invertible if and only if the determinant is non-zero
01:23:09	Xin Yang:	Cool
01:23:28	Ruizheng Shen:	@David Thanks
01:25:05	Feiyang Yu:	How can 4 vectors span R^5?
01:25:20	David Quarel:	4 vectors cannot span R^5
01:25:28	David Quarel:	they can span a subspace of R^5
01:26:24	Louis:	could you plz explain ‘span’
01:26:47	Ge Zhan:	so is rank = # of pivots ?
01:27:12	David Quarel:	Span(v1,...,vn) := {c1 v1 + ... + cn vn: c1,...,cn in R}
01:27:16	Feiyang Yu:	Oh ok I thought the previous slide said the 4 vectors spans R5 thanks David
01:27:20	Joanna:	rank = no. of features?
01:27:50	David Quarel:	rank = number of non-redundant columns, if you like
01:29:29	Ge Zhan:	cool thx !
01:29:34	Louis:	the same as number of independent columns？
01:29:48	David Quarel:	yes
01:29:55	Louis:	got it
01:30:44	Zitian Zhou:	Can Rank be defined as the number of non-zero rows of the matrix?
01:31:20	Louis:	I don't think so
01:31:48	Junhao, Wang:	after Gaussian elimination actually
01:31:54	Zitian Zhou:	Yep
01:31:54	Ge Zhan:	non-zero linearly indepedent rows
01:32:07	Ge Zhan:	I guess
01:32:11	Zitian Zhou:	After Gaussian
01:32:11	David Quarel:	I believe that would be equivalent, but I'd have to prove it to be sure
01:34:09	Yanjun Liu:	just need to observe that after Gaussian elimination, rows of the matrix is either all zeros or contains pivot
01:40:12	Feiyang Yu:	So the complex plane is also a vector space?
01:40:47	Ning Lai:	I think it can be
01:41:34	Linda Kwan:	psi
01:41:40	Junhao, Wang:	kesai I guess
01:41:53	Junhao, Wang:	the pronounciation
01:41:54	David Quarel:	the set of complex numbers C is a vector space, yes
01:43:30	Junhao, Wang:	pronunciation sry for the wrong spelling
01:44:36	Xin Yang:	Orthogonal basis?
01:44:46	David Quarel:	A basis of vectors that are orthogonal
01:45:13	Feiyang Yu:	Are orthogonal basis the same as canonical basis?
01:45:41	David Quarel:	No. The canonical basis is the "usual" choice of basis, e_1 = [1,0,0], e_2 = [0,1,0], e_3 = [0,0,1]
01:45:56	David Quarel:	The canonical basis is an orthogonal basis, but it's not the only one
01:46:34	Feiyang Yu:	So an orthogonal basis can be [1,1] and [1,-1]?
01:46:51	Ge Zhan:	what's requirement of orthogonal basis ?
01:48:37	Jiajie Li:	the product of two vectors are 0?
01:48:52	David Quarel:	It's in the name: It has to be a basis, and all vectors are pairwise orthogonal
01:49:45	Feiyang Yu:	Thank you David
01:49:48	Ge Zhan:	thx David !

02:01:56	Zihan Bao:	Hi, professor, can you add the page numbers on slides ?
02:02:42	Joanna:	Thanks!
02:04:41	Siya Yan:	thx
02:04:48	Alex:	Hi Professor, Could u please explain REF again
02:05:10	Ding Khoo:	For A), the "certain set of vectors" has to be linearly independent and spans the vector space right?
02:05:36	Alex:	it seems all 0 at the bottom according to last week’s slide
02:06:29	Junhao, Wang:	Thanks
02:06:52	Alex:	okay. thanks
02:06:53	Isha Dai:	All 0 below pivots
02:06:55	Surya Teja-u7143732:	From next time if there is any question related to algebraic proof or something is it possible o explain with the help of writing in a white board as it is very difficult sometimes to understand in the slide
02:07:18	Ding Khoo:	vector space
02:07:23	Ding Khoo:	yes
02:09:34	Yucheng Zhao:	Could you please explain again for the second property of the subplace of solutions and dimension? Sorry I cannot catch up with that
02:10:56	Yucheng Zhao:	The more properties
02:11:20	Yucheng Zhao:	The page more properties
02:11:26	Yucheng Zhao:	I think 27?
02:11:48	Yucheng Zhao:	yes
02:11:53	Yucheng Zhao:	the second one
02:13:55	Yucheng Zhao:	yes
02:15:34	Yucheng Zhao:	yes thanks
02:17:21	Karthik Vemireddy:	yes we get the area of interest and crop everything else
02:21:04	yan sun:	U is subspace? The input is subspace?
02:25:32	Alex:	Hi, professor, can u please try to contact the publisher to get the solutions for exercies in the textbook?
02:26:16	yan sun:	The original image is the vector space or subspace?
02:29:24	yan sun:	For second last page
02:31:53	Alex:	sure, no worries. Professor
02:32:12	yan sun:	Thank you Professor
