Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Image Deconvolution


[1. Are the contributions significant?]
Yes. instead of using generate model.

[2. Are the main claims valid?]


[3. Limitations and weaknesses]
1. The network is difficult to train as a whole - Not end to end

[4. Extension and future work]
Still has some noise.

[5. Is the paper stimulating or inspiring?]
Yes. It improved the result much and have a better performance on the noise.

[6. Conclusion and personal reflection]
used CNN to improve the process and get a better result.
Transfor the large 2D convolution into two 1D convolutions (SVD).



Q: What will happen if we directly apply the known kernel?
The result will not be so good. The target is to calculate a kernel to make it better.
