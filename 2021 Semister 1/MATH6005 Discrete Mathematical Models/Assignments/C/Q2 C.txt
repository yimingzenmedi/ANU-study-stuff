I partly agree with this claim, but probability is not just an application of  enumerative combinatorics. Discrete probability models can usually be solved with enumerative combinatorics, for example the probability of throwing a dice a few times to get a certain point. But for the continuous probability model, because there are infinite possibilities, it is impossible to calculate the probability through enumerative combinatorics, for example, the probability of a train arriving at a station in a certain period of time.
