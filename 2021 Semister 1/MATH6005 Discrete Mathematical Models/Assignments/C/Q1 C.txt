I think it is useful. Enumeration combinatoric problems are very common in computer science, such as password cracking, writing test cases, and so on. For example, when writing test cases for white box testing, different input parameters may correspond to different outputs, and we need to test the code completely in all cases by finding all possible combinations of input parameters. Also, when testing a system, a process may consist of multiple small processes, the order of the small processes may affect the output results. When testing, all possible permutations should be found through permutation and combination and verify whether the final result can meet the requirements.
