To play the game, you need to run the [RPGGame.java](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7235649/comp6442_rpggame/-/blob/master/src/Game/RPGGame.java) in Game package.

This game is a text-based RPG game and you need to input the option numbers to process your game.

Please add all the external libraries in the [jar](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7235649/comp6442_rpggame/-/tree/master/jar) folder to ensure your game can run normally.
