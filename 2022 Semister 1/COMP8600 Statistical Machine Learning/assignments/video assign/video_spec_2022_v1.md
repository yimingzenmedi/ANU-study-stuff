# SML Video assignment

The video assignment is an **individual assignment**.
Each student is expected to upload a **4-8 minute-long** video talking about the solution to **one** technical question in SML, and the thinking behind it. Your intended audience is a student who took SML a few years ago without learning the topic you cover in detail. 

A selected subset of well-made videos will be invite to participate in a showcase to the whole SML class. 


## Candidate topics for your videos

Here is a small set of candidate topics for you to choose from. You should feel free to cover a topic outside of this list.

* Different types of regression covered throughout SML 
* Different ways to think about generalisation 
* The EM (Expectation Maxmization) algorithm
* AutoRec and recommender systems.
* Kernel methods.
* Dimensionality reduction, PCA, Kernel PCA and beyond.
* Unusual insights on neural networks. 
* Graphical models, its representation or inference. 
* ... another SML topic of your choosing. We recommend checking with a lecturer/tutor on potential breath and depth before producing your video.


Some tips about what your video can cover:
- You can either pick the questions included in the previous assignments or tutorials, or choose your own SML topic to work with.
If you choose to present your own question, make sure you clearly define the question in your presentation.   
- show how you get to your solution step-by-step.
- explain your mistakes in your original solution, why you made such mistakes, and show the correct version. Note that for this assignment one is not graded on the mistake one made, but by the understanding gain the process and the clarity and creativity of the explanations (see Grading Criteria section). 
- a creative version of the solution different from the solution provided.
- a creative variant of the question different from what was asked. 

Relatively easy questions/topics are expected to be explained in depth.
Contents that are “above and beyond” the assignment itself are welcomed (See *Grading Criteria* below).


## Instruction for producing the video

### Identification requirements 
- Question 2 on Gradescope asks you for a selfie with your ID (ANU ID or another form of ID)
- Your face must be visible and identifiable in the picture. 
- You must present your student ID card to the camera with sufficient detail to read your name and UNI ID. If you do not have an ANU ID due to studying remotely, another form of official ID is also acceptable (e.g. drivers license, passport, national ID). For your own protection, do not to show the barcode or ID number. 
- **failure to comply with this will result in 0 mark for the entire video assignment**.

### Length requirement and penalty
- The length of the video should be between 4 to 8 minutes, with an under- and over- length penalty being 1 point per 10 seconds (or part thereof).

### Video production tips

We recommend clearly stating the question you selected at the beginning of your video, and make the structure of your presentation clear. Read the *Grading Criteria* below carefully, which hopefully provide guidelines for designing your presentation.

The forms of visual aids in the presentation can include, but are not limited to hand-written sheets of paper, slides, illustrations, code, mind maps, whiteboard illustration, solution step summary, informative drawing, etc. We recommend one or a few forms of visual aid for making your point, rather than over-crowding the presentation. 

Two commonly used way to record your video are: 
    - using Microsoft Powerpoint (or similar) with your presentation slides, or
    - using a camera to show your handwritten equations, either on paper or whiteboard.

There are several ways for recording yourself with a presentation

1) we recommend OBS: https://obsproject.com/

With a little luck, you will have this free tool working in just a few minutes, and there are many guides available online to help you. Please be mindful of the video settings however, so that you don't exceed the file size limit below.
One common format is to make your slides full-screen, with a small window for your webcam recording of your face, and then using OBS to record the entire presentation in one take.

2) You could also have a Microsoft Teams or zoom meeting with you as the only participant, record the meeting with your camera on and shared screen if needed. 

### Submission instructions

Submission is done via the "Video Assignment" entry on Gradescope. 
There is a text box asking you to briefly describe the video topic, highlights (if any), and references, followed by a second question asking for the ID picture, and a third question to upload the video. **Please ensure that your uploaded video is playable from within gradescope**, failure to upload a viewable video format will result in penalty appropriate for the trouble that tutors/lectures take to be able to read your content. 

## Grading Criteria

### Show Your Solution (7.5 points)

Students are expected to show the solution in a clear and easy-to-follow way.
The marking criteria including technical correctness and clarity of presentation.

- 6-7.5: Student shows a clear and accurate solution, with a high-quality illustration.
- 5: Student shows a clear and accurate solution.
- 1-4: Most of the content is clear and the illustration is understandable. Some explanation is unclear or inaccurate. One mark penalty for each mistake.
- 0: Most of the presentation is not clear enough and the main idea is hard to follow.

Failure to reference material produced by others will result in a loss of 1-3 marks. 

### Show Your Understanding (7.5 points)

Students are expected to show not only the solution, but also a high-level understanding of it.
For example, what does the equation/coding mean and why it is useful, what can you learn from solving the question, how does it relate to what we learned in the lecture, how do different parts of the SML class relate to each other. 
Any other contents showing your understanding are welcomed.
If you choose a relatively simpler topic, you are expected to show a deeper understanding.

- 5-7.5: The presentation shows a deep understanding of the question and solution. The understanding is logical and accurate.
- 2-4: Student shows understanding but has problems such as, understanding unilateral and simplification, logic confusion and so on.
- 0-1: The presentation includes little understanding of the solution or the understanding is inaccurate.

### Show Your Creativity (5 points)

Students are encouraged to show creativity in the video presentation. 

One can show additional technical depth by clearly presenting materials beyond the assignment and scope of the SML lectures, for example, show active researches related to the assignment questions; design extra experiments to show ideas related to the assignment questions, discuss insights on the pros and cons for the model (with concrete examples).

One can **alternatively, or simultaneously** show creativity for the presentation form. Examples include, but obvious are not limited to creative vivual aid, creative verbal and visual performance. 

- 5: The creative ideas are above-and-beyond. 
- 3-4: Student shows a high level of creativity. The creative ideas are well explained.
- 1-2: Student shows some level of creativity. Some of the creative ideas are not clear.
- 0: The presentation does not show creativity or creative ideas are poorly presented.  

Note that without creative and deeper understanding of the content, the total mark is capped at 16/20.
