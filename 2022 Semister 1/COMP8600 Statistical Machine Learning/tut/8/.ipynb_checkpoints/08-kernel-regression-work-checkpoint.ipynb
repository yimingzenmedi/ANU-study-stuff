    "This notebook contains two parts. Part one is to implement linear regression with a basis function, for example, [a polynomial basis function of degree 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_kernel) as mentioned in week 2, we call it quadratic basis function below. The basis function can be understood as a feature mapping from raw input space into the new feature space. Part two is kernel regression, i.e. linear regression with kernel function $k(\\mathbf{x,y}) = (\\dotprod{\\mathbf{x}}{\\mathbf{y}} + 1)^2$. We'll see the kernel function implementation is equavilant of the quadratic basis function implementation.  \n",

    "First remind yourself of what linear regression is by our implemention of linear regression with regularisation on the Boston dataset. Use 80% of the available data for training the model using maximum likelihood with regularisation (assuming Gaussian noise). The rest of the data is allocated to the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Report the root mean squared error (RMSE) for the training set and the test set. We'll compare the results with the linear regression with basis function, and the linear regression with kernel function later on.\n",

    "**TODO**: Implement the analytic solution of $\\frac{\\partial J(\\mathbf{w})}{\\partial\\mathbf{w}}=0$ in the function  ```w_ml_regularised(Phi, t, l)```, where ```l``` stands for $\\lambda$. Note that $$\\Phi=\n",
